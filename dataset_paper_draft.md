Of course. That is an excellent strategy. Separating the work into two distinct papers—one introducing the dataset and another detailing the detection method—is a common and highly effective academic practice. It allows each paper to have a clear, focused contribution and can lead to two separate publications.

Here is a revised structure for a paper that focuses exclusively on introducing the **dataset itself**. The methodology is now framed as a brief example use case to demonstrate the dataset's value, not as the central contribution.

### **A Channel-Aware AIS Dataset for Maritime Security Research**

**Jóhannus Kristmundsson, *Member, IEEE*, Jákup Svøðstein**

\<br\>

***Abstract***—*The security of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a growing concern, yet research into advanced spoofing detection has been hampered by a lack of public datasets that include physical-layer information. Most available AIS data is limited to kinematic and message content, omitting crucial signal characteristics that can reveal transmitter authenticity. This paper introduces a new, publicly available dataset designed to fill this gap. [cite\_start]Collected over a 10-day period in May 2025, the dataset contains 2,012,183 AIS messages from 999 unique vessels[cite: 35, 36]. [cite\_start]Uniquely, each message is enriched with physical-layer metadata captured by a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver, including received signal power and frequency offset (PPM)[cite: 18, 31]. We provide a detailed description of the data collection methodology, the dataset's structure, and a comprehensive characterization of its features. To demonstrate its utility, we present a brief use case involving a graph-based anomaly detection model that successfully identifies outliers based on these channel-aware features. This dataset provides a valuable resource for developing and validating next-generation maritime security systems, particularly those focused on spoofing detection and radiometric fingerprinting.*

#### **I. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION**

[cite\_start]The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a critical component of global maritime infrastructure, supporting collision avoidance and vessel traffic services[cite: 3, 4]. [cite\_start]Despite its importance, the system's lack of authentication mechanisms makes it vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where malicious actors transmit false information to create "ghost ships" or impersonate legitimate vessels[cite: 6, 7, 8].

[cite\_start]While several methods have been proposed to detect spoofing based on kinematic inconsistencies[cite: 9], they can be defeated by sophisticated attacks. [cite\_start]A more robust approach involves analyzing physical-layer characteristics of the radio signal, which are inherently difficult to forge[cite: 11, 19]. However, progress in this area has been limited by a significant gap: the scarcity of public AIS datasets that include this physical-layer metadata. This paper introduces a new dataset to address this need and enable more advanced security research.

#### **II. DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY**

**A. Receiver Setup**
AIS messages were collected using a stationary, shore-based receiver. The hardware consisted of:

  * [cite\_start]An RTL-SDR v3 USB dongle[cite: 26].
  * [cite\_start]A vertically polarized VHF antenna mounted 60 meters above sea level to ensure a good line-of-sight over the monitored area[cite: 27].

[cite\_start]The system was configured to monitor both AIS channels (161.975 MHz and 162.025 MHz)[cite: 27]. [cite\_start]To ensure the integrity of power measurements, automatic gain control (AGC) was disabled, and a fixed RF gain of 20 dB was maintained throughout the collection period[cite: 28]. [cite\_start]The open-source `AIS-catcher` software was used for real-time GMSK demodulation and decoding, providing access to both the message content and the physical-layer metadata[cite: 29, 30].

**B. Data Acquisition and Structure**
[cite\_start]The data acquisition campaign was conducted continuously from May 8 to May 17, 2025[cite: 35]. [cite\_start]A total of 2,012,183 valid AIS messages were collected from 999 distinct vessels[cite: 35, 36]. [cite\_start]A coverage map of all received positions is shown in Fig. 1 in the original draft[cite: 38, 49].

Each record in the dataset corresponds to a single decoded AIS message and includes the following fields:

  * [cite\_start]**Vessel Identifier:** Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI)[cite: 31].
  * [cite\_start]**Temporal Information:** UTC timestamp[cite: 33].
  * [cite\_start]**Kinematic Information:** Latitude, longitude, Speed Over Ground (SOG), Course Over Ground (COG), and heading[cite: 31, 34].
  * [cite\_start]**Physical-Layer Metadata:** Received signal power (in dB), frequency offset (in PPM), and the AIS channel (A or B)[cite: 31, 33].

#### **III. DATASET CHARACTERIZATION AND VALIDATION**

**A. Signal Power Analysis**
[cite\_start]The received signal power across all messages ranged from -39.4 dB to +7.4 dB[cite: 50]. [cite\_start]A strong relationship between signal power and distance from the antenna was observed, closely following a free-space path loss (FSPL) model in the 10-40 km range[cite: 52]. [cite\_start]At distances less than 5 km, signal power flattens due to clipping in the SDR's front-end, a common artifact in high-SNR conditions[cite: 39, 40].

**B. Frequency Offset Analysis**
[cite\_start]The frequency offset, expressed in parts-per-million (PPM), provides a coarse radiometric fingerprint of the transmitting radio hardware[cite: 45]. [cite\_start]Analysis of the dataset revealed that PPM values were highly consistent for each vessel over time, suggesting that oscillator error is the dominant factor[cite: 46]. [cite\_start]While a weak Doppler shift was also detected, the stability of the baseline offset makes PPM a valuable feature for device-specific identification and spoofing detection[cite: 47, 54, 56]. [cite\_start]The PPM values in the dataset exhibit noticeable quantization, with a dominant step size of approximately 0.289 PPM, a characteristic of the decoding software's frequency estimation algorithm[cite: 58].

**C. Data Quality and Preprocessing**
To ensure the dataset is ready for research applications, a comprehensive 8-stage preprocessing pipeline was applied with exhaustive validation and quality control measures:

**Stage 1: Raw Message Parsing and Initial Validation**
The preprocessing pipeline begins with robust parsing of raw AIS-catcher log files using a multi-stage validation framework:

- **Log Line Pattern Matching:** Employs compiled regex pattern `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} .* - ` to validate timestamp format and reject malformed log entries at line-reading speed
- **UTF-8 Encoding Validation:** All files processed with explicit UTF-8 encoding to handle international vessel names and callsigns
- **JSON Payload Extraction:** Timestamp and JSON payload separated using string split operation `" - "` with error handling for malformed log structures
- **High-Performance JSON Parsing:** Utilizes orjson library providing ≈2× parsing speed improvement over standard Python json module, critical for processing large log files
- **Engine Chatter Filtering:** Non-JSON log lines (AIS receiver status messages, signal quality reports) automatically filtered by payload prefix validation
- **Progress Monitoring:** Real-time processing statistics logged every 10,000 lines with running totals of valid/invalid records

**Stage 2: ITU-R M.1371 Standard Compliance and Message Validation**
Strict adherence to International Telecommunication Union maritime standards with comprehensive field validation:

- **Message Type Validation:** Only processes valid AIS message types with required field presence checking (`"type"` field mandatory)
- **Timestamp Parsing:** Converts AIS-catcher `rxtime` field format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` to UTC pandas datetime objects with microsecond precision
- **Message Classification Taxonomy:** 8-tier classification system mapping message types to semantic categories:
  - Types 1,2,3: "A_pos" (Class A position reports - commercial vessels)
  - Type 18: "B_pos" (Class B position reports - smaller vessels)
  - Type 4: "Base_pos" (Base station position reports)
  - Type 5: "Static" (Static and voyage-related data)
  - Type 21: "ATON" (Aid-to-navigation reports)
  - Type 24: "StaticB" (Class B static data)
  - Others: "Other" (Safety, binary, etc.)

**Stage 3: ITU-R M.1371 Sentinel Value Processing**
Comprehensive handling of standard maritime data sentinel values indicating unavailable or invalid data:

- **Position Sentinels:** `latitude=91.0°` and `longitude=181.0°` → `NaN` (indicates GPS unavailable)
- **Speed Sentinels:** `speed=102.3 knots` → `NaN` (indicates speed data unavailable)
- **Heading Sentinels:** `heading=511°` → `NaN` (indicates compass data unavailable)
- **Draft Sentinels:** `draught=25.5 meters` → `NaN` (indicates draft data unavailable)
- **Field Standardization:** Raw AIS field names mapped to CF-1.8 Climate and Forecast compliant names:
  - `lat`→`latitude`, `lon`→`longitude` (position coordinates)
  - `speed`→`sog` (speed over ground), `course`→`cog` (course over ground)
