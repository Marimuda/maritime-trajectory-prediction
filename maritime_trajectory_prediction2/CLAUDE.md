If I had a "wish list" to maximize the impact and utility of a dataset paper, especially for a rich dataset like the one described (AIS with physical-layer attributes), here's what I'd request:

I. Core Dataset Description & Access:

Figure 1: Geographic Coverage Map (Essential - from PDF)
Optimization: Overlay with known shipping lanes, bathymetry (if relevant to propagation), or major port locations within the coverage area. Annotate the receiver location clearly.

Table 1: Dataset Summary Statistics (Essential)
Total messages
Total unique vessels (MMSI)
Observation period (start/end dates, duration)
Number of AIS channels monitored
Receiver location (Lat/Lon, height ASL)
Brief summary of data formats provided (e.g., Parquet, CSV, Zarr)
Link to dataset repository & DOI (Essential)
License information (Essential)

Table 2: Detailed Field Dictionary (Essential)
For every field in the released dataset:
Field Name (as it appears in the data files)
Description (clear, unambiguous)
Data Type (e.g., int64, float32, string, datetime64[ns])
Units (e.g., dB, PPM, degrees, knots, UTC)
Example Value(s)
Notes/Sentinel Values (e.g., "91.0 for latitude indicates unavailable")
Source (e.g., "AIS Message Type 1", "SDR-derived", "Calculated during preprocessing")

II. Physical-Layer Characterization:

Figure 2: Signal Power vs. Distance (Essential - from PDF)
Optimization: Plot for each AIS channel separately if behavior differs. Clearly show the FSPL model line. Annotate the clipping region. Consider adding error bars or a density plot to show variance.

Figure 3: Frequency Offset (PPM) vs. Radial Velocity (Essential - from PDF)
Optimization: Clearly show the linear fit. Perhaps color-code points by vessel or by signal strength to see if those influence the spread.

Figure 4: Distribution of Received Signal Power (RSSI)
Histogram or Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot of RSSI values.
Optimization: Show distributions per channel (A vs. B) and perhaps for different times of day or for vessels at different distance bands (e.g., <5km, 5-20km, >20km).

Figure 5: Distribution of Frequency Offset (PPM)
Histogram or KDE plot of PPM values.
Optimization: Show distributions per channel. Highlight the quantization steps clearly.

Figure 6: PPM Stability Over Time for Example Vessels
Time-series plots of PPM for a few (3-5) distinct vessels over several hours/days.
Optimization: Choose vessels with long, continuous transmission periods. This visually demonstrates the "fingerprint" stability.

Table 3: Physical-Layer Feature Statistics

For RSSI and PPM:
Mean, Median, Std. Deviation, Min, Max, Interquartile Range (IQR)
Overall and potentially per AIS channel.
Percentage of messages affected by clipping (if quantifiable).
Dominant PPM quantization step size.

III. Kinematic Data Characterization:

Figure 7: Distribution of Speed Over Ground (SOG)
Histogram/KDE of SOG values.

Figure 8: Distribution of Course Over Ground (COG)
Polar histogram or rose plot of COG values.

Figure 9: Distribution of Turn Rates
Histogram/KDE of calculated turn rates.

Figure 10: Example Trajectories
Plot 3-5 example vessel trajectories on the geographic map.
Optimization: Choose diverse examples: a vessel passing through, one maneuvering in port (if applicable), one with a long track. Color-code trajectory points by SOG or RSSI.

Table 4: Kinematic Feature Statistics
For SOG, COG, Heading, Turn Rate, Acceleration:
Mean, Median, Std. Deviation, Min, Max, IQR.
Percentage of messages with valid kinematic data (vs. sentinel values).

IV. Temporal and Message Type Characterization:

Figure 11: Message Reception Rate Over Time
Time-series plot of the number of messages received per hour/day over the entire collection period.
Optimization: Can show diurnal patterns or any collection interruptions.

Figure 12: Distribution of Inter-Message Intervals (per vessel)
Histogram/KDE of the time difference between consecutive messages from the same vessel.

Table 5: AIS Message Type Distribution
Count and percentage of each AIS message type present in the dataset (Types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 18, 19, 21, 24, etc.).

Table 6: Static Data Completeness (for Type 5 & 24 messages)
Percentage of vessels for which key static data fields are available (e.g., Vessel Name, IMO, Call Sign, Vessel Type, Dimensions).

V. Data Quality and Preprocessing Insights:

Table 7: Preprocessing Summary & Outlier Statistics (Essential - from Markdown)
Number of raw messages vs. messages after cleaning/filtering.
Percentage of messages/trajectories affected by each major filtering step (e.g., invalid MMSI, out-of-bounds coordinates, excessive speed/acceleration).
Statistics on trajectory segmentation (e.g., mean/median trajectory length in points and time, number of segments per vessel).

Figure 13: (Optional) Impact of Outlier Filtering
If significant outliers were removed, a before-and-after plot of a relevant distribution (e.g., SOG) could be illustrative.

VI. Cross-Feature Analysis (More Advanced):

Figure 14: Correlation Heatmap
Heatmap showing Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients between key numerical features (RSSI, PPM, SOG, distance from antenna, etc.).
Optimization: Can reveal interesting relationships or confirm expected ones.

Figure 15: RSSI/PPM by Vessel Type (if static data allows)
Box plots of RSSI and PPM grouped by broad vessel categories (e.g., Cargo, Tanker, Fishing, Pleasure Craft).
Optimization: Could reveal if certain vessel types tend to have different signal characteristics (though this is more about the transmitter than the vessel itself, it might show trends in equipment used).

VII. Use Case Demonstration (Brief):

Figure 16: Anomaly Detection Example Output
If a simple anomaly detection was run (as mentioned with the graph autoencoder), a plot showing example normal vs. anomalous trajectories/points highlighted by the model.
Optimization: Keep this very high-level, just to showcase potential.
Statistical Analyses to Support These:
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, stddev, min, max, quantiles) for all key features.
Frequency distributions and histograms.
Correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman).
If comparing groups (e.g., RSSI on Channel A vs. B), appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, or non-parametric equivalents if data isn't normal).
Linear regression (as done for PPM vs. Radial Velocity).

Why this Wish List?

Comprehensive Understanding: Gives potential users a deep understanding of what the data contains, its characteristics, and its quirks.

Builds Trust: Detailed characterization and quality metrics demonstrate rigor and transparency.

Facilitates Use: Helps researchers quickly assess if the dataset is suitable for their specific problem and how to approach it.

Sparks Ideas: Seeing diverse analyses can inspire new research questions.

Highlights Novelty: Clearly showcases the unique aspects (like the physical-layer data and its properties).

This is an extensive list, and not all may be feasible or necessary for every dataset paper. However, aiming for this level of detail and visualization significantly enhances the paper's value and the dataset's adoption by the research community. The key is to provide enough information for others to confidently and effectively use your valuable data.

Please examine which ones of these we are able to deliver
