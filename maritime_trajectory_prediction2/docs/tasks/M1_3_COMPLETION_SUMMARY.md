# M1.3 Classical ML Baselines - Implementation Complete ✅

## Git Workflow Summary

### Branch Management
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/m1.3-classical-ml` created via git worktree
- **Worktree Location**: `/home/jakup/repo/maritime-m1.3-classical` (now removed)
- **Merge Strategy**: No-fast-forward merge to preserve feature history
- **Final Commit**: `79af753` on main branch

### Clean Git Operations Performed
1. ✅ Created feature branch with worktree isolation
2. ✅ Implemented all code with proper linting compliance
3. ✅ Fixed all linting issues (magic numbers, bare except, etc.)
4. ✅ Committed with conventional commit format
5. ✅ Pushed feature branch to remote
6. ✅ Merged into main with descriptive merge commit
7. ✅ Cleaned up worktree and feature branches (local & remote)
8. ✅ Pushed updated main to remote

### Key Features Implemented
- **SVR Baseline**: RBF kernel with MultiOutputRegressor wrapper
- **Random Forest**: Native multi-output with feature importance analysis
- **Time-Aware CV**: PurgedTimeSeriesSplit with configurable gap
- **Feature Engineering**: Maritime-specific features (turn rates, acceleration)
- **Delta Prediction**: Predict changes vs absolute positions
- **Uncertainty Estimation**: Model-specific uncertainty quantification
- **Parallel Training**: Multi-horizon training with joblib

### Code Quality
- All linting issues resolved
- Magic numbers replaced with named constants
- Proper exception handling (no bare except)
- Type hints throughout
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Follows existing codebase patterns

## Integration Points

### Leverages Existing Infrastructure
- Uses `TrajectoryBaseline` protocol from Kalman implementation
- Extends factory pattern in `baseline_models/__init__.py`
- Compatible with Lightning wrapper pattern (optional)
- Follows XGBoost model pattern for consistency

### Library Dependencies (Minimal Resistance)
```python
# Primary
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

# Supporting
from joblib import Parallel, delayed
import pandas as pd  # For time-series features
import numpy as np   # Numerical operations
```

## Next Steps

### Testing (M1.4)
```python
# Example usage
from src.models.baseline_models.classical import SVRBaseline, RFBaseline

# Create and train
svr = SVRBaseline()
svr.fit(train_sequences, max_horizon=12)

# Predict with uncertainty
result = svr.predict(test_sequence, horizon=12, return_uncertainty=True)
```

### Integration with Evaluation Framework
- Ready for statistical validation (M1.1 evalx framework)
- Can be compared against Kalman baselines (M1.2)
- Performance benchmarking vs neural models

## Repository State
- **Main branch**: Up to date with remote
- **Feature branch**: Deleted (local and remote)
- **Worktree**: Removed cleanly
- **Git history**: Clean with proper merge commit

The M1.3 Classical ML Baselines milestone is now complete and fully integrated into the main branch.
