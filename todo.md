# AIS Codebase Refactoring TODO

## Phase 1: Analyze current codebase structure and identify issues
- [x] Extract and examine the uploaded codebase
- [x] List all Python files and understand directory structure
- [x] Check git history and author information
- [x] Examine main Python files for code quality and structure
- [x] Identify duplicate files and inconsistent organization
- [x] Document current issues and refactoring needs

### Issues Found:
1. Many duplicate files in root directory that should be in maritime_trajectory_prediction/src/
2. Many empty files that need proper implementation
3. CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE_chatlog.txt files should be removed
4. Inconsistent project structure with files scattered in root
5. Git configuration is correct (jakupsv author)

## Phase 2: Create proper module structure and organize code
- [x] Remove duplicate files in root directory
- [x] Organize code into proper package structure
- [x] Create proper __init__.py files with exports
- [x] Move configuration files to appropriate locations
- [x] Set up proper project structure with setup.py/pyproject.toml

## Phase 3: Fix imports and dependencies according to best practices
- [x] Update all import statements to use relative imports where appropriate
- [x] Fix circular import issues
- [x] Ensure proper dependency management
- [x] Update requirements.txt with correct versions
- [x] Test all imports work correctly

## Phase 4: Update git configuration and clean up repository
- [ ] Set proper git author configuration
- [ ] Clean up any Claude-related files or references
- [ ] Update commit messages if needed
- [ ] Ensure .gitignore is properly configured

## Phase 5: Test refactored code and create documentation
- [ ] Run existing tests to ensure functionality is preserved
- [ ] Create additional tests if needed
- [ ] Update README.md with proper project structure
- [ ] Document the refactoring changes

## Phase 6: Package and deliver refactored codebase
- [ ] Create final package structure
- [ ] Generate requirements and setup files
- [ ] Package the refactored code
- [ ] Provide summary of changes made
